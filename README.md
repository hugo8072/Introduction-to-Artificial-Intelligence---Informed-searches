This project focuses on optimizing the placement of railway stations in the Old West during the 
railway boom era. The railway's introduction transformed transportation and facilitated the 
movement of people and goods, promoting territorial expansion. The territory is divided into
 NxM zones, with varying family distributions, and the objective is to strategically place 
stations to best serve the population while minimizing costs.

Objectives

-Minimize the number of railway stations.
-Minimize the average cost of traveling to the nearest station.
-Ensure the average travel cost does not equal or exceed 3.
-Use informed search algorithms to identify the optimal station locations within given constraints.
-The project involves calculating travel costs based on distance and optimizing station placement to achieve the lowest possible costs. The evaluation criteria and calculations will follow specific guidelines to ensure effective and efficient solutions.
